## About

🚀 **Full Stack AI Developer**

I started my career ensuring software works flawlessly — now I build systems that think for themselves.

With a strong foundation in automation and software reliability, I transitioned into the AI space and never looked back. Today, I design and build SaaS and PaaS solutions powered by AI, helping clients solve unique problems with speed, scalability, and intelligence.

I bring a "nothing is impossible to build" mindset to every project — whether it's integrating LLMs into existing workflows, automating decision-making systems, or creating cloud-native applications that just work smarter.

### My Approach

- ⚙️ **Build fast, but build right** — Quality-first development rooted in reliability
- 🧠 **Learn fearlessly** — From new AI frameworks to obscure APIs
- 💡 **Focus on value** — Reliability, security, and ROI at the core

I'm passionate about where AI meets automation, and I'm always looking for ways to push technology beyond what it's "supposed" to do.
